## The Radio Wave Article


The 1920s was a period of significant growth and development in the field of radio communication, with advances in technology and increasing interest in amateur radio.

At the time, the US government was responsible for regulating the use of the radio spectrum, and different frequency bands were allocated to different users. In 1922, the Department of Commerce judged short waves (frequencies under 200 meters) to be worthless for long-distance communication and allocated them to radio amateurs, with the longer wavelengths being assigned to the military, the RCA, AT&T and various broadcasting services. 

Although this move was meant to hurt the ham radio space, electronics hobbyists fervently explored this uncharted territory of the radio spectrum and quickly made significant advances, most notably:

1. In 1923, radio amateurs discovered that they could use 100-meter waves to communicate with Europe
2. Litton and a fellow member of the Stanford radio club were among the first American Amateurs to establish communicationin the high frequency bands with Australia and New Zealand. 
3. In 1928, Eitel pioneered the use of 10-meter waves for transcontinental communication

Eitel commented this about his accomplishment: "I was bringing up the rear when the movement (towards higher frequencies) started, but by the time they got to 20 meters I was up with them. I beat them all in spanning the continent on 10 meters. In order to do this work, I had to build everything myself."

The decision to allocate shortwave frequencies to radio amateurs clearly had unintended consequences. As shortwave communication became more important for long-distance communication, commercial and government users began to push for access to these frequencies, leading to a dispute over the use of the radio spectrum.

The US Congress eventually passed the Radio Act, which established the Federal Radio Commission (later the Federal Communications Commission) and gave it the authority to regulate the use of the radio spectrum. The act also established a system of frequency allocation that divided the spectrum between different radio services, including amateur radio, commercial radio, and government users.

In retrospect, it is clear that the decision to allocate shortwave frequencies to radio amateurs in 1922 was a mistake. However, this mistake was ultimately rectified through the establishment of the Federal Radio Commission and the development of a more rational system of frequency allocation that took into account the needs of all radio users.
