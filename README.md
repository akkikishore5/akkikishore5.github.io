## The Radio Wave Article


The 1920s was a period of significant growth and development in the field of radio communication, with advances in technology and increasing interest in amateur radio.

At the time, the US government was responsible for regulating the use of the radio spectrum, and different frequency bands were allocated to different users. In 1922, the Department of Commerce judged short waves (frequencies under 200 meters) to be worthless for long-distance communication and allocated them to radio amateurs.

However, this decision turned out to be a mistake, as it was soon discovered that short waves were actually ideal for long-distance communication, particularly for point-to-point communication over large distances. With the development of new vacuum tube technology, ham radio operators like Eitel and Litton began to experiment with shortwave communication and discovered that they could transmit over much longer distances than was previously thought possible.

By the mid-1920s, shortwave technology had advanced to the point where transcontinental and even transoceanic communication was possible, and radio amateurs played a key role in advancing this technology.

However, the decision to allocate shortwave frequencies to radio amateurs had unintended consequences. As shortwave communication became more important for long-distance communication, commercial and government users began to push for access to these frequencies, leading to a dispute over the use of the radio spectrum.

In 1927, the US Congress passed the Radio Act, which established the Federal Radio Commission (later the Federal Communications Commission) and gave it the authority to regulate the use of the radio spectrum. The act also established a system of frequency allocation that divided the spectrum between different radio services, including amateur radio, commercial radio, and government users.

In retrospect, it is clear that the decision to allocate shortwave frequencies to radio amateurs in 1922 was a mistake. However, this mistake was ultimately rectified through the establishment of the Federal Radio Commission and the development of a more rational system of frequency allocation that took into account the needs of all radio users.
